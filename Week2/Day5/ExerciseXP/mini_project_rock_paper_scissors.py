# Key Python Topics:

# OOP (Classes, Methods)
# Modules (Importing)
# Random Number Generation (random.choice())
# User Input and Validation
# Conditional Logic
# Loops (while)
# Data Structures (Dictionaries)
# Game Logic

# What You Will Create:

# A Rock Paper Scissors game where the user plays against the computer, with a menu, game logic, and score tracking.

# Instructions:

# Create a directory for the game.
# Create rock-paper-scissors.py (for menu, input, and summary).
# Create game.py (for game logic).

# Part I - game.py

# Step 1: Create the Game Class

# Step 2: Implement get_user_item Method

# Create a method called get_user_item(self).
# Ask the user to select an item (rock/paper/scissors).

# Step 3: Implement get_computer_item Method

# Create a method called get_computer_item(self).
# Randomly select an item (rock/paper/scissors).
# Return the computer’s item.

# Step 4: Implement get_game_result Method

# Create a method called get_game_result(self, user_item, computer_item).
# Take user_item and computer_item as parameters.
# Determine the result of the game based on the rules of Rock Paper Scissors.
# Return “win”, “draw”, or “loss”.

# Step 5: Implement play Method

# Create a method called play(self).
# Call get_user_item() to get the user’s choice.
# Call get_computer_item() to get the computer’s choice.
# Call get_game_result() to determine the result.
# Print the outcome of the game (user’s choice, computer’s choice, result).
# Return the result (“win”, “draw”, or “loss”) as a string.

# Example (Conceptual, No Direct Solution):

# import random

# class Game:
#     def get_user_item(self):
#         # ... code to get and validate user input ...
#         # ... code to return user's choice ...

#     def get_computer_item(self):
#         # ... code to generate computer's choice ...
#         # ... code to return computer's choice ...

#     def get_game_result(self, user_item, computer_item):
#         # ... code to determine and return game result ...

#     def play(self):
#         # ... code to get user and computer choices ...
#         # ... code to determine game result ...
#         # ... code to print game outcome ...
#         # ... code to return game result ...

# Part II - rock-paper-scissors.py

# Step 6: Implement get_user_menu_choice Function

# Create a function called get_user_menu_choice().
# Display the menu options (“Play a new game”, “Show scores”, “Quit”).
# Get the user’s choice.
# Validate the input (e.g., check if it’s one of the valid options).
# Return the user’s choice.

# Step 7: Implement print_results Function

# Create a function called print_results(results).
# Take a dictionary called results as a parameter (e.g., {"win": 2, "loss": 4, "draw": 3}).
# Print the results in a user-friendly format (e.g., “Wins: 2, Losses: 4, Draws: 3”).
# Thank the user for playing.

# Step 8: Implement main Function

# Create a function called main().
# Pepeatedly show the menu until the user chooses to exit.
# Call get_user_menu_choice() to get the user’s choice.
# If the user chooses to play a game:
# Create a Game object.
# Call the play() method of the Game object.
# Store the result of the game in a dictionary (e.g., results).
# If the user chooses to exit:
# Call print_results() to display the game summary.
# Exit the program.

# Example (Conceptual, No Direct Solution):

# # rock-paper-scissors.py
# from game import Game

# def get_user_menu_choice():
#     # ... code to display menu and get user choice ...
#     # ... code to validate user input ...
#     # ... code to return user choice ...

# def print_results(results):
#     # ... code to print results in a user-friendly way ...
#     # ... code to thank user ...

# def main():
#     # ... code to call all the related functions depending on the user's choice.

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()

from rock_paper_scissors import main

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
